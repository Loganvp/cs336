          Every night in my dreams
          <br />I see you, I feel you
          <br />That is how I know you, go on
          <br />
          <br />Far across the distance
          <br />And spaces between us
          <br />You have come to show you, go on
          <br />
          <br />Near, far, wherever you are
          <br />I believe that the heart does go on
          <br />Once more you open the door
          <br />And you're here in my heart and my heart will go on and on
          <br />
          <br />Love can touch us one time
          <br />And last for a lifetime
          <br />And never let go till we're gone
          <br />
          <br />Love was when I loved you
          <br />One true time I hold you
          <br />In my life we'll always go on
          <br />
          <br />Near, far, wherever you are
          <br />I believe that the heart does go on
          <br />Once more you open the door
          <br />And you're here in my heart
          <br />And my heart will go on and on
          <br />
          <br />You're here, there's nothing I fear
          <br />And I know that my heart will go on
          <br />We'll stay forever this way
          <br />You are safe in my heart and my heart will go on and on
