##Vision Statement
*Meta or Not* is a web service to help better the community of Star Wars X-Wing
miniatures. Through the help of the community, we can show what the masses
believe are the best lists (combination of ships, pilots, and upgrade cards)
to currently play the game. Each person can contribute by voting their expected
win percentage for two matchups. *Meta or Not*'s interface allows for easy
voting and viewing of the two lists.
